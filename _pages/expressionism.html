<h3>Expressionism</h3>

<p>Expressionism was an artistic movement that emerged in Germany after World War I. Influenced by Primitivism and Nietzschean philosophy, expressionism rejected modern bourgeois norms, especially materialism and the growth of industry, which it saw as complacent. In response, expressionists focused on subjective self-expression against rationalism in both literature and the visual arts. In the visual arts, bold colors and contrasts characterized expressionism, which influenced artists as diverse as Edvard Munch, Vincent Van Gogh, and James Ensor.</p>

<p>Expressionist poetry featured bold imagery that echoed the intense contrasts of expressionist painting, abrupt breaks and striking rhythms. A major figure was Gottfried Benn. Drama, typified by Bertolt Brecht, was abstract and highly visual, often featuring long monologues and tableaux. Expressionist literary works experimented with non-referentiality, instead focusing on abstract ideas, and serving as a precursor to figures such as Samuel Beckett and the surrealists.</p>

<h3>Fauvism</h3>

<p>Fauvism was a movement in the visual arts that preceded Cubism and was aesthetically related to German Expressionism. Similar to expressionism, Fauvism reacted against impressionism and used bright colors and strong lines and contrast. Fauvism was concentrated in France, with famous figures including Henri Matisse and Georges Braque.</p>
