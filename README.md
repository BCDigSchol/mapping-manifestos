## About

This site that focuses on the attributes and scope of (primarily) European artistic manifestos, especially in the early twentieth century. The site contains:

1. an explanation of the manifesto as a genre and contextual information surrounding its genesis (in "What is a Manifesto?")
2. visualizations of the temporal and geographical scope of manifesto production in the form of a general map which shows the physical distribution of all manifestos (in "What is a Manifesto?"), and a timeline of all manifestos in the database

3. A searchable database of 103 manifestos which can be filtered by school, country, and year (in "Resources")

4. General information on major and minor artistic schools which often include smaller maps showing the distribution of manifestos within that school (in "Artistic Movements")

5. A provisional list of attributes that can be found across manifestos (In "Future Directions")

6. Future directions for the projects and its use in research (in "Future Directions")

This project also fills a gap in the digital humanities, because while there are multiple sites which have digitized modernsit journals, there are none which have mapped or begun large-scale analysis of manifestos as a unique genre. Within traditional scholarship, there are a few anthologies (see References in "What is a Manifesto?"), and some work done on individual schools or manifestos, but little that looks at the genre as a whole, or considers the manifesto
